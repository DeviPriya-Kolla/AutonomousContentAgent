The agent will operate in a simple, linear workflow.
Start: The main script (agent.py) is executed.
Perceive (Check for News): The agent fetches the latest article from a specified RSS feed.
Check Memory (Have I seen this?): It compares the article's link to a list of links it has already processed.
If Yes: The agent stops. The work is done for this run.
If No: The agent proceeds. This is a new content opportunity!
Perceive (Get Context): The agent reads the brand_voice.txt file to understand how it should write.
Think (Draft Content): The agent sends the article title and the brand voice instructions to the LLM and asks it to draft a post.
Act (Present Output): The agent prints the generated draft to the console.
Update Memory: The agent adds the new article's link to its list of processed links so it doesn't process it again.
End: The script finishes.
